## Options for Dummies 

 INTRODUCTION

Financial derivatives have been around for at least 200 hundred years since the Japanese introduced the first secondary market for derivatives related to commodities. Nevertheless, they made their debut in the U.S. after the Chicago Board of Trade was founded, in 1848, to organize commodities trading activities. These markets introduced futures and opened the doors for many new financial instruments including options. In this chapter, we will explain the basics of how options work and how they are usually employed in today‚Äôs modern financial markets.
An option is a contract between two parties giving the taker (buyer) the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a security at a predetermined price on or before a predetermined date. To acquire this right, the taker pays a premium to the writer (seller) of the contract.

```

### CALL OPTIONS

A call option is a financial contract that gives the holder the right, but not the obligation,
to purchase a certain underlying asset at a certain price, known as the strike price.
For example, ABC Corporation is trading at $120. A one-month call option is trading for $3.50.
The buyer of this call option has the right, but not the obligation to buy 100 shares of ABC 
for $120 per share at any time during the life of the contract. For this right, the buyer of 
the contract pays $3.50 to the seller.
The seller of the contract receives and keeps the $3.50 but is obligated to deliver 100 shares
at $120 if called upon to do so.

### PUT OPTIONS
In turn, a put option is a financial contract that gives the holder the right, but not the
obligation, to sell a certain underlying asset at the strike price on or before expiry.
Using the example of ABC Corporation trading at $120, a one-month put option is trading at $4.00.
The buyer of this put option has the right, but not the obligation to sell 100 shares of ABC for
$120 per share at any time during the life of the contract.
For this right, the buyer of the put contract pays $4.00 to the seller.
The seller of the contract receives and keeps the $4.00 but is obligated to buy 100 shares
at $120 if called upon to do so.

### RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS

The fact that the individual or institution who holds the option has the right and not the obligation to exercise the derivative means that if the result of the operation turns out to be unprofitable, the holder can abstain from completing the transaction and his sole loss would be the premium paid to purchase the option.
On the other hand, if the holder does exercise the option, the seller of the option must fulfill the contract.



              Buyer: has all the rights       Seller: get all the obligation
                         
                         
                        
 CALLS         ------------        Right to buy the asset       -------------------------       Obliged to sell the asset

 PUTS          ------------        Right to sell the asset      -------------------------        Obliget to buy the asset




### Why Use Options‚òë

Options can be used for four main purposes:

‚òëÔ∏è Hedging/Risk Management

‚òëÔ∏è Leverage

‚òëÔ∏è Income

‚òëÔ∏è Speculation


### HEDGING / RISK MANAGEMENT

Options are a fantastic tool for hedging exposure to a certain asset. Let‚Äôs say an investor has a portfolio of S&P500 stocks and is concerned about a drop in their value over the next few months.


Buying an SPX put option would give the investor some downside protection. If the S&P500 falls, the value of the investors stock portfolio will drop, but he will have made some profits from the bought put which will help offset the losses.
This is a simple example and there are many different ways in which options can be used for hedging and risk management.

### LEVERAGE

Since options cost only a small fraction of the price of the underlying asset an investor can gain a larger exposure to a certain security by buying put or call options instead of buying the underlying asset directly. This particular feature of options is known as leverage.
Let‚Äôs say you want to invest in ABC Corporation stock, as you think the price of its shares will go up over the next 3 months. If you have $1,000 and the shares cost $50 you could only buy 20 shares.
Instead, you could buy 2 call option contracts for $500 that give you the right to buy 100 ABC Corporation shares at $50, 3 months from now.
If the price of ABC‚Äôs shares goes up to $60 you will earn a 20% return if you invested in the shares directly.
At expiry, the $50 call option would be worth $10 with the underlying stock trading at $50. In this case, the call option has achieved a 100% return.
However, leverage cuts both ways and if the stock doesn‚Äôt move as expected, the investor could lose 100% of their investment.

### INCOME

Using options to generate income is a popular strategy with investors. Covered calls are a logical place for stock investors to start because it is an easy scenario to understand.
Investors who sell call options on shares they own, can produce an income in addition to any dividends earned.
By selling a call option, the investor gets to keep the option premium, but there is a possibility that the shares will get called away if the stock price rises above the strike price of the sold call.
Covered calls will be covered in more detail shortly.
Other investors will use options to generate income on shares they have no ownership of via more advanced strategies such as vertical spreads, iron condors, calendar spreads and butterflies.
SPECULATION
Many investors and traders will use options to speculate on the market. Those expecting the market to rise might buy call options in the hope of making a large potential return.
Those expecting the market to drop might buy put options. Other traders may opt for income generating strategies.
The great thing about options is that there are many strategies that can be used, no matter what your market outlook or opinion.


### Option Features

In this chapter, we‚Äôll take a look at the seven basic characteristics of all option contracts:

‚òëÔ∏è Underlying Asset

‚òëÔ∏è Call vs Put

‚òëÔ∏è Contract Size

‚òëÔ∏è Expiration Date

‚òëÔ∏è Strike Price

‚òëÔ∏è Premium

‚òëÔ∏è American Vs European


### UNDERLYING ASSET

As we know, the definition of an option is that it is a contract giving the owner (buyer) of the option the right (but not the obligation) to buy or sell a defined quantity of a defined asset. This asset is called the underlying asset or sometimes just underlying.
Options can be traded on many different underlying assets, particularly in the United States and the universe of underlying assets has expanded rapidly in the last five to ten years.
The most common underlying assets are common stocks (shares in companies trading on the stock exchange).
Other popular assets for option traders include indexes such as the S&P 500, Nasdaq and Russell 2000. The Russell 2000 is a particular favorite with option traders because of the high volatility, high liquidity and 10 point strikes.
Options can also be traded on futures, bonds, interest rates, currencies and ETF‚Äôs.

### CALL VS PUT

There are two basic types of options ‚Äì call options and put options. As a reminder A call option gives you the right, but not obligation, to buy the underlying asset. A put option gives you the right, but not obligation, to sell the underlying asset. CONTRACT SIZE
An options contract represents exposure to a number of underlying shares. The standard contract size is generally 100.
This can occasionally change if there is a corporate action such as a reorganization or a new issuance of shares.
In the case of an index option, the contract value is fixed at a certain number of dollars per index point. The size of the contract is equal to the index level x the dollar value per index point. For example, S&P500 (SPX) options have a value of $100, so for an option contract with a strike price of 2,800, one contract would be 2,800 x 100 = 280,000.

### EXPIRATION DATE

Options have a limited life span and expire on a certain date. The expiration date is the day on which all unexercised options expire and can no longer be traded. The expiration date is fixed during the life of an option and will not change. Any options that are not exercised before expiration become worthless.
The expiration date for listed stock options in the United States is normally the third Friday of the contract month or the month that the contract expires. On months that the Friday falls on a holiday, the expiration date is on the Thursday immediately before the third Friday.
Some brokers will automatically exercise any options that are in-the-money by more than $0.01. If a trader doesn‚Äôt want the option to be exercised, they should close out the position prior to expiration.
European style monthly Index options also expire on a third Friday of the month, however the last trading day for Index options is the Thursday. This can result in a significantly different settlement price than the Thursday closing price. 
In the last few years there has been an explosion in the number of weekly options available. In some underlying instruments like SPX, there are options expiring every few days.

### STRIKE PRICE

The strike price is the predetermined price for buying or selling the underlying asset.
The strike price does not change through the life of the option unless there is a corporation action such as a reorganization.
Depending on the underlying asset, there are usually many different strike prices available.
Taking a quick look at SPY options for the next month‚Äôs expiration date shows strike prices available from $140 to $225 in 5-point intervals then from $225 to $325 in 1-point intervals, then again from $325 to $400 in 5-point intervals.
Compare that to a less popular underlying asset like IYT and we have $155 to $175 in 5-point intervals, then $175 to $200 in 1-point intervals and $200 to $220 in 5-point intervals.

### PREMIUM

The premium is the price of the option which is determined by the buyer and seller of the option. Option premium is determined by market participants with market makers playing a huge role in determining the price of options.
Option premiums are quoted in cents per share. To calculate the total premium cost, traders need to take the price in cents times the multiplier. An option contract quoted at $1.20 would cost $120 to buy ($1.20 x 100).
Option premiums are higher for high volatility stocks which reflects the chance of higher movement in the underlying over the course of the options life.
For example, an at-the-money call option on a high volatility stock like ROKU trades for around $14.00 whereas a similar call on a low volatility stock like JNJ trades for around $4.00.
Option premium will also depend on the price of the underlying stock. A stock like AMZN which is currently trading at $1720 has at-the-money options trading around $65.
Compare that to a low-price stock like GE which is trading at $8.30 where at-the-money options trade for only $0.20 - $0.30.

### AMERICAN VS EUROPEAN
 
The difference between American and European options relates to when the owner of the option can exercise the option. American style options can be exercised at any point during the options life, but a European style option can only be exercised at a single point in its life ‚Äì the moment it expires.
Exercising an option has nothing to do with trading an option and both style of options trade exactly the same way during their lifetime.
The terms American and European have nothing to do with geographic locations. Both types of options trade in many places. European style options are very common on American exchanges (SPX, RUT and NDX are all European style options).
Use Cases of Options
Let‚Äôs look at some practical examples of how you can make options work for you.

### INCOME GENERATION

Selling call options against shares already owned is one of the simplest and most rewarding ways to trade options. It‚Äôs a great way to get started for those that are new to options.
It‚Äôs a logical place to start if you‚Äôre familiar with share ownership.
Selling options over shares you own, generates income in additional to any dividends earned while holding the shares. The risk of course, is that your shares might get called away if they rise strongly. You are also limited your upside because any gains the stock makes above the strike price are not captured.


Let‚Äôs look at a couple of examples:


### SCENARIO 1: SELLING OPTIONS ON SHARES YOU ALREADY OWN

Assume you already hold 100 shares of ABC Corporation as part of a diversified long-term retirement portfolio.
The current price is $60 and you would be happy to sell your shares if the price reached $62.50. You look in your brokerage account and see that a 3-month $62.50 call option is trading with a bid price of $0.98 and an ask price of $1.02.
You place an order to sell the $62.50 call option for $1.00 which is the mid-point of the bid-ask spread.
Assuming your order gets filled, you will receive $100 in premium ($1.00 x 100 shares in the contract) which is yours to keep.
As an option seller, you now have the obligation to sell your shares for $62.50 if called upon to do so at any time during the life of the option.
  
   If ABC Corporation is trading above $62.50 at expiry, your shares will be called away and you will have made a nice profit.
IF ABC Corporation is trading below $62.50 at expiry, you get to keep your shares, and the $100 option income. You can now continue to hold the shares or sell a new call option.

### SCENARIO 2: SELLING A PUT OPTION ON A STOCK YOU ARE HAPPY TO OWN

In this example, you don‚Äôt own any ABC Corporation shares, but would be happy to buy them for $57.50.
Upon checking the option quotes, you see that a 3-month $57.50 put option on ABC Corporation is trading with a bid price of $1.12 and an ask price of $1.16.
You place an order to sell the $57.50 put option for $1.14. Assuming your order is filled, you receive $114 in premium.
You now have the obligation to buy 100 shares of ABC Corporation at $57.50 if called upon to do so during the life of the option.
If ABC Corporation is trading above $57.50 at expiry, your put option expires worthless and you have generated $114 in income.
If ABC Corporation is trading below $57.50, your put option will be assigned and you will be required to buy 100 shares at $57.50.
The net cost of the purchase is $56.36 which is calculated as the strike price less the premium received ($57.50 - $1.14).
Selling put options is a great way to take ownership of shares you want to buy for a lower cost price.
The downside is that $114 is the maximum profit you can make, no matter how high ABC Corporation‚Äôs shares go.

### PORTFOLIO PROTECTION
Options are a fantastic way to protect against a short-term fall in a stock‚Äôs price without having to sell your shares.
Selling call options was covered under income generation and does give some small protection against a drop in a stock‚Äôs price, but the protection is limited to the amount of premium received.
Any further falls are not protected.
A way to obtain more protection is by buying a put option.
Using ABC Corporation again, the stock is trading at $60 and you are worried about a sharp decline. You want to lock in a sale price in case things get really bad.
  
Instead of selling the 3-month $57.50 put option as in the previous example, this time we buy the put option.
The put option costs $1.14 or $114 in total and we have a guaranteed sale price of $57.50, no matter how low the stock goes.
Even if the company goes bankrupt and the share price goes to $0, you can still sell you shares for $57.50. You can see why options are such a great tool for portfolio protection!
Think of buying a put like buying an insurance contract. You pay a premium and receive coverage in the event of a disaster.
If the disaster doesn‚Äôt happen, you lose the premium that you paid, but you don‚Äôt mind because you were able to sleep at night knowing that you had protection against the worst-case scenario.

### LEVERAGED EXPOSURE

Speculators can choose to try and profit by predicting movements in the underlying shares. Traders can achieve far greater returns using options as opposed to just buying or selling shares.
Buying call options allows traders to profit from an increase in the price of the underlying asset.
Buying 100 shares can be prohibitively expensive for some investors but buying call options allows traders to leverage their capital to potentially achieve higher returns.
The flip side with leverage of course is the higher risk and when buying call options, there is always a chance that the investor will lose 100% of their investment.


### ADVANCED STRATEGIES

Selling call options and buying calls and puts are simple strategies to get started in options trading. However, the possibilities are almost endless and there are many ways to trade different market opinions. This include advanced strategies such as:

üöÄ Iron Condors

üöÄ Ratio Spreads

üöÄ Wheel Trade

üöÄ Strangles and Straddles

üöÄ Risk Reversal

üöÄ Double Diagonals

###    -Option Pricing-



Option prices are determined by mathematical models such as the Black-Scholes or Binomial pricing models. Most traders do not have a thorough understanding of these models and to be honest, they don‚Äôt need to. The main thing to understand is that there are six key factors that determine an options price:


-Current price of the underlying asset

-The time to expiration

-The strike price of the option

-The level of implied volatility

-Interest rates

 Any dividends payable during the life of the option
Before we look at the six factors, let‚Äôs discuss Intrinsic Value and Extrinsic Value (Time Value).

### INTRINSIC VALUE

Intrinsic value is the difference between the strike price of the options and the current price of the underlying asset.
It is the portion of an option‚Äôs price that is not lost due to the passage of time.

### CALL OPTION INTRINSIC VALUE

The intrinsic value of a call option can be calculated as the underlying asset price minus the call strike price.
Let‚Äôs say ABC Corporation is trading at $105 and a $100 call option is trading for $7. This call option has intrinsic value of $5, calculated at $105 - $100. The remaining $2 is time value or extrinsic value.
If we had a $110 call option trading for $0.50, it would have $0 intrinsic value because the call option is out-of- the-money. $105 minus $110 is less than zero so there is zero intrinsic value and the option price is made up entirely of time value.

### PUT OPTION INTRINSIC VALUE

For a put option the intrinsic value is calculated as the put strike price minus the price of the underlying asset.
In our ABC example, a put with a strike price of $110 would have $5 of intrinsic value ($110 - $105) and a put with a strike price of $95 would have zero intrinsic value and be made up entirely of time value.

### TIME VALUE OF OPTIONS

Time value of an option is the amount of the option premium that is not made up of intrinsic value.
Time value is calculated as the option price minus the intrinsic value.
The longer in time until an options expiry, the greater the time value.
Time value represents the amount you are prepared to pay for the possibility of the market moving in your favour during the life of the option.
Time value will vary between in-the-money, at-the-money and out-of-the-money options and is highest for at- the-money options.
Out-of-the-money options are comprised entirely of time value.
Deep in-the-money options will be made up of mostly intrinsic value and will have very little time value.
As time draws closer to expiry, the chance of a favourable movement in the underlying asset declines and therefore the time value declines.
This erosion of time value is called time decay. Time decay picks up speed as expiration approaches. 


### TIME VALUE AND VOLATILITY

Time value is very much impacted by the anticipated level of volatility during the options life. A highly volatility stock will have much larger time value than a low volatility stock.
This represents the increased chance that the volatile stock will make a big move during the options life.
At the time of writing ROKU, a high-flying tech stock with high volatility was trading around the same price as Proctor and Gamble a stable low volatility stock in the consumer goods sector.
ROKU implied volatility is around 88% and PG implied volatility is at 22%, as a result we would expect ROKU options to be MUCH more expensive.
From the two tables below, it‚Äôs clear to see that ROKU options have much higher time value across the board.
As ROKU is a much more volatile underlying asset than PG, there is a much greater chance that the stock will make a big move during the next 31 days and this is reflected in the option prices.
For example, the $105 strike puts are almost worthless at only $0.30 for PG, this reflects the fact that market participants think there is very little chance of PG reaching this level before expiry.
The ROKU $105 put on the other hand is valued at $5.30 showing that the market thinks there is a good chance that ROKU might reach that level before expiry.


### OPTION PRICING AND VOLATILITY

As we have seen above, the level of volatility can have a big impact on the prices of options, but how do we know the volatility of an underlying asset?
There are two different types of volatility ‚Äì historical volatility and implied volatility.
Historical Volatility is calculated by measuring an assets stocks past price movements. It is a known figure as it is based on past data.
The data is readily available, so there is no need to calculate it yourself. The main point you need to know here is that in general, stocks that have had large price swings in the past will have high levels of Historical Volatility.
As options traders, we are more interested in how volatile a stock is likely to be during the duration of our trade. Historical Volatility will give some guide to how volatile a stock has been, but there is no way to predict future volatility.
The best we can do is estimate it and this is where implied volatility comes in.
Implied volatility is an estimate, made by professional traders and market makers of the future volatility of a stock. It is the only unknown factor in the options pricing model, because there is no way to know for certain how volatile a stock will be in the future. The best we can do is estimate it based on past behaviour and current market events.
Implied Volatility takes into account any events that are known to be occurring during the lifetime of the option which may have an impact on the price of the underlying stock.
This could include an earnings announcement or the release of drug trial results for a pharmaceutical company.
The current state of the general market is also incorporated into implied volatility estimates. If markets are calm, volatility estimates are low, but during times of market stress volatility estimates will be raised.
One very simple way to keep an eye on the general market levels of volatility is to monitor the VIX Index.

### OPTION PRICING AND INTEREST RATES

Interest rates also have an impact on option prices, however the impact is minimal and certainly much less than the impact of volatility.
Shorter-term options are also less impacted by changes in interest rates.
When interest rates rise, call option prices will increase while put option prices will decrease.
The logic behind this is as follows. Assume an investor wants to take an exposure to a particular stock. Instead of buying the shares which might cost say $10,000, the investor buys call options total for $1,000. Buying the call options gives a similar exposure and the remaining $9,000 can be invested to earn some interest. Higher interest rates mean higher income on the $9,000. This makes the call option more attractive and therefore more expensive.
The opposite is true for put options. With high interest rates, put options are less attractive. This is because rather than holding the asset and buying a put option, the investor would be better off simply selling the asset and investing the proceeds at the higher interest rate.

### OPTION PRICING AND DIVIDENDS

Cash dividends affect option prices through their effect on the underlying stock price. Because the stock price is expected to drop by the amount of the dividend on the ex-dividend date, high cash dividends imply lower call premiums and higher put premiums.
Options prices will anticipate the dividend amounts weeks and months in advance.
Dividends are an important factor when deciding whether to exercise options early. Whoever owns the stock on the ex-dividend date receives the dividend, so call option holders may exercise the option early in order to capture the dividend.



### LAST STEP: THE GREEKS

Armed with Greeks, an options trader can make more informed decisions about which options to trade and when to trade them. Consider some of the things Greeks may help you do:

Gauge the likelihood that an option you‚Äôre considering will expire in the money (Delta).
Estimate how much the Delta will change when the stock price changes (Gamma).
Get a feel for how much value your option might lose each day as it approaches expiration (Theta).
Understand how sensitive an option might be to large price swings in the underlying stock (Vega).
Simulate the effect of interest rate changes on an option (Rho).


Greeks, including Delta, Gamma, Theta, Vega and Rho, measure the different factors that affect the price of an option contract. They are calculated using a theoretical options pricing model.

Since there are a variety of market factors that can affect the price of an option in some way, assuming all other factors remain unchanged, we can use these pricing models to calculate the Greeks and determine the impact of each factor when its value changes. For example, if we know that an option typically moves less than the underlying stock, we can use Delta to determine how much it is expected to move when the stock moves $1. If we know that an option loses value over time, we can use Theta to approximate how much value it loses each day.

Now, let's define each Greek in more detail.


üëâ [Video Explainer for the lazy homies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33mgja-YrDY)

### Delta: The hedge ratio

The first Greek is Delta, which measures how much an option's price is expected to change per $1 change in the price of the underlying security or index. For example, a Delta of 0.40 means that the option‚Äôs price will theoretically move $0.40 for every $1 move in the price of the underlying stock or index.

Call options

Have a positive Delta that can range from 0.0 to 1.00.
At-the-money options usually have a Delta near 0.50.
The Delta will increase (and approach 1.00) as the option gets deeper in the money.
The Delta of in-the-money call options will get closer to 1.00 as expiration approaches.
The Delta of out-of-the-money call options will get closer to 0.0 as expiration approaches.


Put options

Have a negative Delta that can range from 0.0 to -1.00.
At-the-money options usually have a Delta near -0.50.
The Delta will decrease (and approach -1.00) as the option gets deeper in the money.
The Delta of in-the-money put options will get closer to -1.00 as expiration approaches.
The Delta of out-of-the-money put options will get closer to 0.0 as expiration approaches.
 
You can think of Delta, as the probability that a given option will expire in the money. For example, a Delta of 0.40 means the option has about a 40% chance of being in the money at expiration. This doesn‚Äôt mean your trade will be profitable. That of course, depends on the price at which you bought or sold the option.

You also might think of Delta, as the number of shares of the underlying stock, the option behaves like. A Delta of 0.40 also means that given a $1 move in the underlying stock, the option will likely gain or lose about the same amount of money as 40 shares of the stock.


### Gamma: the rate of change of Delta

Gamma measures the rate of change in an option‚Äôs Delta per $1 change in the price of the underlying stock. Since a Delta is only good for a given moment in time, Gamma tells you how much the option‚Äôs Delta should change as the price of the underlying stock or index increases or decreases. If you remember high school physics class, you can think of Delta as speed and Gamma as acceleration.

Let's walk through the relationship between Delta and Gamma:

Delta is only accurate at a certain price and time. In the Delta example above, once the stock has moved $1 and the option has subsequently moved $.40, the Delta is no longer 0.40. As we stated, this $1 move would cause a call option to be deeper in the money, and therefore the Delta will move closer to 1.00. Let's assume the Delta is now 0.55. This change in Delta from 0.40 to 0.55 is 0.15‚Äîthis is the option‚Äôs Gamma.

Because Delta can‚Äôt exceed 1.00, Gamma decreases as an option gets further in the money and Delta approaches 1.00.

### Theta: time decay

Theta measures the change in the price of an option for a one-day decrease in its time to expiration. Simply put, Theta tells you how much the price of an option should decrease as the option nears expiration.

Since options lose value as expiration approaches, Theta estimates how much value the option will lose, each day, if all other factors remain the same.

Because time-value erosion is not linear, Theta of at-the-money (ATM), just slightly out-of-the-money and in-the-money (ITM) options generally increases as expiration approaches, while Theta of far out-of-the-money (OOTM) options generally decreases as expiration approaches.


### Vega: sensitivity to volatility
Vega measures the rate of change in an option‚Äôs price per 1% change in the implied volatility of the underlying stock. While Vega is not a real Greek letter, it is intended to tell you how much an option‚Äôs price should move when the volatility of the underlying security or index increases or decreases.

More about Vega:

Vega measures how the implied volatility of a stock affects the price of the options on that stock.
Volatility is one of the most important factors affecting the value of options.
A drop in Vega will typically cause both calls and puts to lose value.
An increase in Vega will typically cause both calls and puts to gain value.
 
Neglecting Vega can cause you to overpay when buying options. All other factors being equal, when determining strategy, consider buying options when Vega is below ‚Äúnormal‚Äù levels and selling options when Vega is above ‚Äúnormal‚Äù levels. One way to determine this is to compare the historical volatility to the implied volatility. Chart studies for both of these values exist within StreetSmart Edge¬Æ.

Rho: sensitivity to interest rates
Rho measures the expected change in an option‚Äôs price per one percentage point change in interest rates. It tells you how much the price of an option should rise or fall if the risk-free interest rate (U.S. Treasury-bills)* increases or decreases.

More about Rho:

As interest rates increase, the value of call options will generally increase.
As interest rates increase, the value of put options will usually decrease.
For these reasons, call options have positive Rho and put options have negative Rho.
 
Rho is generally not a huge factor in the price of an option, but should be considered if prevailing interest rates are expected to change, such as just before a Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting.

Long-Term Equity AnticiPation Securities¬Æ (LEAPS¬Æ) options are far more sensitive to changes in interest rates than are shorter-term options. 

You can see the effects of Rho by considering a hypothetical stock that‚Äôs trading exactly at its strike price. If the stock is trading at $25, the 25 calls and the 25 puts would both be exactly at the money. You might see the calls trading at a price of $0.60, while the puts may trade at a price of $0.50. When interest rates are low, the difference will be relatively small. As interest rates increase, this difference between puts and calls whose strikes are equidistant from the underlying stock will get wider.
