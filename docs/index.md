## OOptions for Dummies 

INTRODUCTION

Financial derivatives have been around for at least 200 hundred years since the Japanese introduced the first secondary market for derivatives related to commodities. Nevertheless, they made their debut in the U.S. after the Chicago Board of Trade was founded, in 1848, to organize commodities trading activities. These markets introduced futures and opened the doors for many new financial instruments including options. In this chapter, we will explain the basics of how options work and how they are usually employed in today’s modern financial markets.
An option is a contract between two parties giving the taker (buyer) the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a security at a predetermined price on or before a predetermined date. To acquire this right, the taker pays a premium to the writer (seller) of the contract.
