## Options for Dummies 

 INTRODUCTION

Financial derivatives have been around for at least 200 hundred years since the Japanese introduced the first secondary market for derivatives related to commodities. Nevertheless, they made their debut in the U.S. after the Chicago Board of Trade was founded, in 1848, to organize commodities trading activities. These markets introduced futures and opened the doors for many new financial instruments including options. In this chapter, we will explain the basics of how options work and how they are usually employed in today‚Äôs modern financial markets.
An option is a contract between two parties giving the taker (buyer) the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a security at a predetermined price on or before a predetermined date. To acquire this right, the taker pays a premium to the writer (seller) of the contract.

### CALL OPTIONS

A call option is a financial contract that gives the holder the right, but not the obligation,
to purchase a certain underlying asset at a certain price, known as the strike price.
For example, ABC Corporation is trading at $120. A one-month call option is trading for $3.50.
The buyer of this call option has the right, but not the obligation to buy 100 shares of ABC 
for $120 per share at any time during the life of the contract. For this right, the buyer of 
the contract pays $3.50 to the seller.
The seller of the contract receives and keeps the $3.50 but is obligated to deliver 100 shares
at $120 if called upon to do so.

### PUT OPTIONS
In turn, a put option is a financial contract that gives the holder the right, but not the
obligation, to sell a certain underlying asset at the strike price on or before expiry.
Using the example of ABC Corporation trading at $120, a one-month put option is trading at $4.00.
The buyer of this put option has the right, but not the obligation to sell 100 shares of ABC for
$120 per share at any time during the life of the contract.
For this right, the buyer of the put contract pays $4.00 to the seller.
The seller of the contract receives and keeps the $4.00 but is obligated to buy 100 shares
at $120 if called upon to do so.

### RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS

The fact that the individual or institution who holds the option has the right and not the obligation to exercise the derivative means that if the result of the operation turns out to be unprofitable, the holder can abstain from completing the transaction and his sole loss would be the premium paid to purchase the option.
On the other hand, if the holder does exercise the option, the seller of the option must fulfill the contract.

### Why Use Options‚òë

Options can be used for four main purposes:

‚òëÔ∏è Hedging/Risk Management ÔÇ∑ Leverage
‚òëÔ∏è Income
‚òëÔ∏è Speculation

### HEDGING / RISK MANAGEMENT

Options are a fantastic tool for hedging exposure to a certain asset. Let‚Äôs say an investor has a portfolio of S&P500 stocks and is concerned about a drop in their value over the next few months.


Buying an SPX put option would give the investor some downside protection. If the S&P500 falls, the value of the investors stock portfolio will drop, but he will have made some profits from the bought put which will help offset the losses.
This is a simple example and there are many different ways in which options can be used for hedging and risk management.

### LEVERAGE

Since options cost only a small fraction of the price of the underlying asset an investor can gain a larger exposure to a certain security by buying put or call options instead of buying the underlying asset directly. This particular feature of options is known as leverage.
Let‚Äôs say you want to invest in ABC Corporation stock, as you think the price of its shares will go up over the next 3 months. If you have $1,000 and the shares cost $50 you could only buy 20 shares.
Instead, you could buy 2 call option contracts for $500 that give you the right to buy 100 ABC Corporation shares at $50, 3 months from now.
If the price of ABC‚Äôs shares goes up to $60 you will earn a 20% return if you invested in the shares directly.
At expiry, the $50 call option would be worth $10 with the underlying stock trading at $50. In this case, the call option has achieved a 100% return.
However, leverage cuts both ways and if the stock doesn‚Äôt move as expected, the investor could lose 100% of their investment.

### INCOME

Using options to generate income is a popular strategy with investors. Covered calls are a logical place for stock investors to start because it is an easy scenario to understand.
Investors who sell call options on shares they own, can produce an income in addition to any dividends earned.
By selling a call option, the investor gets to keep the option premium, but there is a possibility that the shares will get called away if the stock price rises above the strike price of the sold call.
Covered calls will be covered in more detail shortly.
Other investors will use options to generate income on shares they have no ownership of via more advanced strategies such as vertical spreads, iron condors, calendar spreads and butterflies.
SPECULATION
Many investors and traders will use options to speculate on the market. Those expecting the market to rise might buy call options in the hope of making a large potential return.
Those expecting the market to drop might buy put options. Other traders may opt for income generating strategies.
The great thing about options is that there are many strategies that can be used, no matter what your market outlook or opinion.
